# jhu-reproducable-research-assignment2
The "Reproducable Research" Coursera Course through John Hopkins University as a project 2 assignment.   That assignment mentions to publish publically, on RPub the solution to the assignment.   Given the assignment is asking for publication of all sources via the publically available RPub site.  I figured it might be good to keep a git repository which has the steps, via git history, that I have used to make the research.  Naturally, because of the large size of the input data file, I will not be committing that to the repository.   However, it should be retrivable by the R scripts I decide to write.
